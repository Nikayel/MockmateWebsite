## Five layers you reason with, two you argue about

The 7-layer OSI model is a reference diagram, not how real systems are built. In practice you reason
about a 5-layer stack, and the only two layers you will argue about in interviews are L4 and L7.

Bottom to top, the practical stack:

\`\`\`
  L7  HTTP / gRPC / app semantics   (methods, headers, paths, request bodies)
  L6  TLS                            (encryption, identity, SNI)   <- sits between
  L4  TCP / UDP                      (ports, connections, reliability)
  L3  IP                             (addresses, routing, MTU)
  L2  Link                           (Ethernet, MAC, the wire)
\`\`\`

Each layer has one job. IP (L3) moves packets between hosts by address and decides routing hop by
hop; it knows nothing about ports or requests, and it is where MTU and fragmentation live (jumbo
frames, the classic 1500-byte Ethernet MTU). TCP and UDP (L4) address a specific process on a host
via a port number and, for TCP, add reliability. TLS secures the byte stream. HTTP (L7) carries the
application meaning: this is a \`POST /orders\`, this is \`Authorization: Bearer ...\`, this is a 404.

### L4 versus L7: the decision that matters

An L4 load balancer (AWS NLB, IPVS, a hardware LB) forwards packets or TCP connections. It sees the
4-tuple and that is roughly all: it cannot read a URL path, a Host header, or a cookie, so it cannot
route \`/api\` to one pool and \`/images\` to another. It is cheap, extremely fast, and
protocol-agnostic (it will happily proxy a database connection). An L7 load balancer or reverse proxy
(Envoy, NGINX, AWS ALB, HAProxy in HTTP mode) terminates the connection, parses the request, and can
route on path, header, or method, do TLS termination, retries, and rate limiting. That power costs
CPU and adds latency.

A connection is identified by its 4-tuple: \`(source IP:source port, destination IP:destination
port)\`. This is why one client can hold many simultaneous connections to the same server (each uses
a different ephemeral source port) and why a NAT gateway can multiplex thousands of internal hosts
behind one public IP by rewriting ports. It is also why L4 load balancing has to keep a connection
pinned to the same backend: the 4-tuple is the only identity it has.

**Interview nuance:** interviewers probe whether you conflate an L4 LB with L7 routing. If you say
"the load balancer routes \`/checkout\` to the payments service," you have quietly assumed an L7
proxy. Say so, and note the cost: TLS termination and request parsing on every request.

**Interview nuance:** TLS does not have a clean OSI number (people say L5, L6, or "between 4 and 7").
Do not die on that hill. Say "TLS sits on top of TCP and below HTTP" and move on.

Recap: Reason in a practical 5-layer stack, remember IP routes packets and TCP/UDP address processes
by port, and know that L4 sees only the 4-tuple while L7 can read and route on request content.

              "**Components mapped to layers:** an L4 load balancer (NLB, IPVS) operates on TCP, sees the 4-tuple `(client IP:port, VIP:443)`, and forwards the connection to a backend pinned by that tuple, reading nothing above TCP. A TLS terminator (edge box, ALB, Envoy) operates at the TLS layer: it decrypts, which is what unlocks L7. A reverse proxy or L7 LB (Envoy, NGINX, ALB) operates at L7: with TLS terminated it reads `Host` and path, routes `/orders` to the orders pool, and applies per-route retries and rate limits. The app server also lives at L7.",

This tier must stay at L4: at 500 Gbps you cannot afford to terminate TLS and parse HTTP on attack traffic, and most volumetric attacks are not even valid HTTP.",
              "**Tier 2 is L7,** reached only by traffic that survived tier 1 and completed a TCP+TLS handshake (which already filters most spoofed sources, since a spoofer cannot complete the handshake).

Layering lets cheap stateless work shed the bulk while expensive stateful work sees only legitimate-looking, handshake-completing traffic.",
