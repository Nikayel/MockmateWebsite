## Four guarantees, not one buzzword

ACID is four separate guarantees that people blur into one buzzword. The way to sound senior is to
say what each one protects against with a concrete failure in mind.

**Atomicity** means a transaction is all-or-nothing. A money transfer is a debit on one row and a
credit on another. If the process crashes, or a constraint fails, or the network drops between the
two writes, atomicity guarantees the database rolls back to the state before the transaction started.
Without it you get the classic bug: 100 dollars leaves account A and never arrives at account B
because the second write failed. The invariant "total money is conserved" only holds if both writes
commit together or neither does.

**Consistency** in ACID is not a free property the database grants you. It means the database moves
from one valid state to another valid state as defined by your constraints and your application
logic. The database enforces the part you declared: \`CHECK (balance >= 0)\`, \`NOT NULL\`, foreign
keys, unique constraints. Everything else (a transfer must not create money) is an invariant your
transaction plus isolation must uphold. Consistency is the outcome; atomicity, isolation, and your
constraints are the mechanism.

**Isolation** means concurrent transactions do not corrupt each other. If two transfers touch the
same account at once, isolation determines whether one sees the other's half-finished work. This is
the hardest and most-probed guarantee, and the next lesson is entirely about its levels.

**Durability** means once the database returns "committed," that data survives a crash, a power
loss, or a kill -9. The concrete mechanism: the change is written and \`fsync\`'d to the write-ahead
log (WAL) on durable storage before the commit acknowledgment is sent. A commit that is only in a
memory buffer is not durable; if the box loses power, it is gone. This is why a synchronous commit
costs a disk \`fsync\` (often a few ms), and why "group commit" batches many transactions into one
\`fsync\` to amortize it.

**Interview nuance:** When asked "is your write durable?" the strong answer names the WAL and
\`fsync\`, and flags the tradeoff: \`synchronous_commit = off\` in Postgres returns faster but risks
losing the last few hundred ms of commits on a crash. Money says on; a like counter can say off.

### When is strict ACID worth its cost?

When a violated invariant means lost money, double-charged users, or corrupted balances, pay for it:
a single-primary relational database (Postgres, MySQL InnoDB) with real transactions. When the
invariant is soft (a view count, a feed ordering) you can relax to BASE (basically available, soft
state, eventual consistency) and buy horizontal scale and availability instead.

\`\`\`
BEGIN
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = A;  -- debit
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = B;  -- credit
COMMIT   -- atomic: both or neither; durable: fsync'd WAL before ack
\`\`\`

Recap: ACID is four concrete guarantees; atomicity makes debit+credit all-or-nothing, durability
means fsync'd to the WAL not just memory, and consistency is your invariant enforced by constraints
plus isolation, not a free lunch.

Idempotency is enforced at both layers.",
              "**Concurrency:** two simultaneous retries of the same key race on the unique insert; exactly one wins and proceeds, the other blocks then reads the winner's result. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the intent row serializes state transitions so the machine never double-advances.",
